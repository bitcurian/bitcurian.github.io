I'm a full-stack machine learning engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. 
This site is a space for me to share my work, insights, and ongoing projects in computer vision, natural language processing, and AI-driven safety solutions.
I've created this website to create a collection of my blog posts and project deep dives that go beyond my resume.
I explore the practical applications of technologies like PyTorch, Active Learning, Computer Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), Transformers, and foundation models.
